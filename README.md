# Eastern Dictionary

Vietnamese dictionary with an emphasis on its old script.

This was my first project. I came up with it before starting university as I was really into studying languages during break. I wouldn't consider this a good project compared to the ones I made after freshman year, but it displays the MERN stack. I removed a lot of clutter and functionalities that made the web application harder to use. Now it's just put in a word to get it's definition.
